          <h3>Trip to Ljubljana, Slovenia in 2018</h3>
          <p>
            The trip to Ljubljana, Slovenia was a spontaneous trip with friends
            during the summer in 2018. We were bored and decided to travel to
            Slovenia due to its close proximity to Zagreb, Croatia. So, we drove
            over 1 hour from Croatia to Slovenia to explore the charming streets
            and experience the unique culture of this incredible destination.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we arrived in Slovenia we primarily walked through the city
            center, and was astonished by the colorful architecture and lively
            atmosphere of the city. The pedestrian-only streets made it easy to
            explore the city as everything we needed was within a walking
            distance. The city was so easy to navigate we walked for hours until
            we come across the magnificent Ljubljanski grad, the ancient castle
            that sits atop a hill overlooking the city. My friends and I decided
            to make the climb up to the castle, eager to explore the fascinating
            history and take in the breathtaking views from the top.

          <h4>Enjoying The Castle and Walking In The City</h4>
          <p>
            Once you reach the castle, were were immediately captivated by the
            stunning architecture and panoramic views of the city below. After
            paying a small fee for entrance, we spent hours wandering through
            the ancient ruins, marveling at the fascinating exhibits and
            learning about the rich history of the area and learning about the
            country's history with dragons.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the highlight of my visit is the incredible meal I shared with
            my friends and girlfriend at the Castle Cuisine - Ljubljana -
            Ljubljanski grad. The food is absolutely delicious, with a perfect
            blend of local and international flavors. I savor every bite and
            enjoy the stunning views of the city below, feeling grateful for
            this incredible experience with the people I love the most.

            In the end I would highly reccomend this city for anyone looking to

            center to enjoying a delicious meal at the castle, you've had an
            unforgettable adventure in this incredible destination. You know
            that you'll always look back on this trip with fondness, remembering

          <h3>Trip to Koper, Slovenia in 2022</h3>
          <p>
            Since I enjoyed my trip to Slovenia in past I decided to return the
            country again to experience what other beauty it has to offer. So, I
            took a random day trip to Koper during the summer. As I arrive in
            Koper, Slovenia, I immediately struck by the city's beautiful
            location on the Adriatic Sea. Koper is a small coastal town with a
            rich history and unique culture, and I excited to explore everything
            it has to offer.

          </figure>
          <p>
            I started my trip by taking a stroll through the charming streets of
            the old town, admiring the colorful Venetian-style buildings and
            picturesque squares. The town is rich in history, and I can feel the
            sense of tradition and culture as I explore the winding streets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, I make my way to the Praetorian Palace, one of the most
            impressive landmarks in the town. This stunning palace was built in
            the Venetian Gothic style in the 15th century and has been
            beautifully preserved over the years. After exploring the palace,
            you head down to the harbor, where I admired the beautiful of the
            boats and ships in the clear blue waters. I took a stroll along the
            promenade, enjoying the salty sea air and the stunning views of the
            coastline.

          <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>
            Finally, I made my way to the town square, where I relaxed and enjoy
            a coffee and meal at one of the many charming cafes and restaurants.
            I savor the local cuisine, which features fresh seafood and
            delicious Mediterranean flavors. That is why I would highly
            reccomend this spot for a summer vacation as the locals are friendly
            and the veiw of the city and sea is equally as amazing.
