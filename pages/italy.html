          <h3>Trip To Rome, Italy During March 2017</h3>
          <h4>First Day In Rome</h4>
          <p>
            Rome is a city full of history, culture, and delicious food.
            Visitors can explore ancient ruins, admire beautiful artwork and
            architecture, and indulge in some of the best Italian cuisine. While
            there I had the opportunity to visit all most every historic spots
            in the city since I was there for a few days on a solo trip.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started my first day off by visiting one of the most iconic
            attractions in Rome, the Colosseum, an ancient amphitheater that
            once hosted gladiator battles and other public spectacles. I took
            the guided tour to learn about its history and explore its tunnels
            and levels. The tour was not expensive at the time I was there and
            well worth the money as I was able to learn some very important
            information about the Colosseum.
          </p>

            />

          </figure>
          <h4>Last Few Days In Rome</h4>
          <p>
            Another attraction that I saw on the same day was the Vatican City,
            the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church and home to numerous
            museums and galleries. Here, I spent a few hours just walking around
            admiring different aspect of the city, to include the stunning
            Sistine Chapel, with its famous ceiling painted by Michelangelo.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next two days I spent mostly walking around the city seeing
            other historic landmarks and eating Italian food. The historic
            landmarks includes places such as the Pantheon, the Roman Forum, and
            the Trevi Fountain. Walking around the city can feel like stepping
            back in time, as there are so many buildings and monuments that are
            centuries old. Food is a major part of the Italian culture, and Rome
            is no exception. I really enjoyed the delicious pizza, pasta, and
            gelato at a wide range of restaurants and cafes. I cannot reccomend
            a specific resturants since most offer similar food thats equally
            amazing. The cost of the food is relatively cheap so you are able to
            eat out everyday while visiting Rome.
          </p>

          <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>
            Overall, a trip to Rome offers a rich cultural experience that can't
            be missed. Whether you're interested in history, art, or food, there
            is something for everyone in this beautiful city. The locals are
            quite friendly but be aware that English is rarely spoken and taxis
            mostly only take cash.
          </p>
          <h3>Trip To Milan, Italy During November 2017</h3>
          <p>
            Milan is one of the most vibrant and fashionable cities in Italy,
            known for its stunning architecture, rich history, and vibrant
            cultural scene. If you decide to visit Milan also, you can enjoy
            exploring historic landmarks, shopping for designer fashion, and
            indulging in delicious Italian cuisine. But beware that unlike Rome,
            Milan is significantly more expensive and it would hard for me to
            reccomend eating at every resturant you see unless you have the
            money to spend.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the most famous attractions in Milan is the Duomo, a
            magnificent Gothic cathedral that took nearly six centuries to
            complete. Tourists can climb to the top of the cathedral to enjoy
            stunning views of the city, which is well worth it. If the Duomo di
            Milano is not to your liking, there are also other amazing places
            close by, such as the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II; one of the
            world's oldest shopping malls.
          </p>

          </figure>
          <p>
            Walking through the plaza is well worth the trip to Milan as I was
            able to see the true beauty of the city to include the Leonardo da
            Vinci museum. In the museum I spent over 1 hour just looking at the
            different inventions and drawing created by Leonardo.

          <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>
            Whether you're interested in exploring ancient landmarks or
            indulging in the latest fashion trends, Milan has something for
            everyone to enjoy.
