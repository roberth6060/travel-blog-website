                  I have heard so much about this country's stunning landscapes,
                  charming historic cities, and unique cultural delights. While
                  visiting Austria I stayed in Vienna due to the recommendation
                  of a close friend. I managed to visit various locations within
                  Vienna area that I thoroghly liked. One of the locations are
                  the Dom Museum Wein, located in Vienna, Austria, is a museum
                  that focuses on art and culture related to the Catholic

                  Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, is a vibrant and livable
                  city with a population of over 1.3 million people in the
                  metropolitan area (worldpopulationreview, 2023). Denmark is
                  also known for being a social democracy, which means that it
                  is a society that combines elements of capitalism with a
                  strong welfare state. This system is characterized by a high
                  level of social and economic equality, as well as a commitment
                  to universal healthcare, education, and social services. The
                  city has a reputation for being one of the happiest cities in
                  the world, and living there for a year its not hard to see
                  why. From my experience the people there are always happy and
                  always enjoy spending time off work with family and friend,

                  days on a solo trip. I started my first day off by visiting
                  one of the most iconic attractions in Rome, the Colosseum, an
                  ancient amphitheater that once hosted gladiator battles and
                  other public spectacles. I took the guided tour to learn about

                  there in 2016 at U.S. Embassy Japan. One of the first things I
                  noticed upon arriving Minato-Ku, Tokyo is how safe and clean
                  the city is. Crime rates are very low, and the streets are
                  meticulously maintained, making it a pleasant and easy place
                  to navigate. The public transportation system, including

                  to travel to Slovenia due to its close proximity to Zagreb,
                  Croatia. So, we drove over 1 hour from Croatia to Slovenia to
                  explore the charming streets and experience the unique culture
                  of this incredible destination. When we arrived in Slovenia we
                  primarily walked through the city center, and was astonished
                  by the colorful architecture and lively atmosphere of the
                  city. The pedestrian-only streets made it easy to explore the
                  city as everything we needed was within a walking distance.
                  The city was so easy to navigate we walked for hours until we

                  Black Cab prices cost us a £150 to our location which was near

                  the UK as we were able visit select few places due to high

                  day after arriving in UK our first stop was the iconic Big Ben
                  clock tower. We snap some photos and take in the stunning
