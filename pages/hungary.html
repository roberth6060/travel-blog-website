          <h4>Budapest: Paris of the East</h4>
          <p>
            Budapest is a beautiful city located in central Europe, known for
            its rich history, stunning architecture, and vibrant cultural scene.
            According to a article written by vingtparis it is often referred to
            as the "Paris of the East" due to its elegant boulevards, grand
            buildings, and romantic atmosphere.Though I have never been to
            Paris, France I do plan to visit the country in the future to see if
            the similarity between Paris and Budapest are true.
          </p>
          <h4>Trip With Friends</h4>
          <p>
            Early this year my friend from American along with his girlfriend
            from France visited my family and I in Croatia for a week, so we
            collectively decided to drive to close by country while they were
            here. From the recommendation of my friend's girlfriend we decided t
            to drive to Budapest, Hungary because she always wanted to visit due
            to hearing it was similar to Paris. So, we dicided to take 3 day
            trip to Budapest to experience everything the city have to offer.
          </p>
          <p>
            When visiting budapest we manage to see various landmarks and
            historic by using the Budapest Sightseeing Tour Package. One of the
            most iconic landmarks we manage to see while on the bus is the
            Hungarian Parliament Building, which is the largest building in
            Hungary and one of the most beautiful parliamentary buildings in the
            world. Other notable sights in Budapest include Buda Castle,
            Fisherman's Bastion, and St. Stephen's Basilica.
