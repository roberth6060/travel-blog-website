          <h3>Arriving In Japan</h3>
          <p>
            Living in Tokyo, Japan for a few months was an incredible and
            unforgettable experience. As one of the world's largest and most
            vibrant cities, Tokyo offers a unique blend of ancient traditions
            and cutting-edge modernity, making it a fascinating place to Explore
            and discover especially for an individual that is avid anime
            watchers and manga reader that is why I was elated when I was
            offered the opportunity to work temporarily there in 2016 at U.S.
            Embassy in Japan.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the first things I noticed upon arriving Minato-Ku, Tokyo is
            how safe and clean the city is. Crime rates are very low, and the
            streets are meticulously maintained, making them a pleasant and easy
            place to navigate. The public transportation system, including
            trains, buses, and subways, is also incredibly efficient and
            reliable, allowing you to easily travel throughout the city and
            beyond.
          </p>

          <h3>Food In Japan</h3>
          <p>
            Another notable aspect of life in Tokyo is the incredible food
            scene. From world-renowned sushi and ramen to delicious street food
            and high-end dining experiences, Tokyo is a foodie's paradise. While
            there I was able to enjoy traditional Japanese cuisines, such as
            sushi, tempura, yakitori, ramen, tonkatsu, miso soup, onigiri,
            gyoza, and edamame. Though at first, I was not a big fan of Remen as
            I was not able to utilize the chopsticks to eat the Ramen. But after
            being in the country for a while I eventually become good at using
            chopsticks at the same proficiency as a local and Ramen is my
            favorite dish.

          <h3>Accommodation, Entertainment and Cultural Experiences</h3>
          <p>
            In terms of accommodation, Tokyo offers a wide range of options to
            suit different budgets and preferences. You can find everything from
            small apartments to luxurious high-rise condos, and there are plenty
            of resources available to help you find the right place to call home
            during your stay.
          </p>
          <p>
            When it comes to entertainment and cultural experiences, Tokyo is
            hard to beat. There are numerous museums, galleries, and historical
            sites to explore, as well as plenty of opportunities to experience
            traditional Japanese culture, such as tea ceremonies, kabuki
            theater, and sumo wrestling matches. The city is also home to a
            thriving nightlife scene, with bars, clubs, and music venues to suit
            all tastes. Overall, living in Tokyo for a few months is a unique
            and enriching experience, with endless opportunities to explore and
            discover the city's rich history, culture, and cuisine. Whether
            you're interested in ancient traditions or cutting-edge technology,
            Tokyo has something for everyone.

          <h3>My Favourite Location In Japan</h3>
          <figure>
            <img
              src="../assets/images/japan/IMG_2670.JPG"
              alt="Senso-ji Temple"
              srcset=""
            />
            <figcaption>Me at the Senso-ji Temple, Asakusa</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Senso-ji, also known as Asakusa Kannon Temple, is one of the oldest
            and most popular Buddhist temples in Tokyo, Japan. Visiting Senso-ji
            is an unforgettable experience that offers a glimpse into Japan's
            rich cultural and religious heritage.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you approach the temple, you will be greeted by the impressive
            Kaminarimon Gate, which is adorned with a large red lantern and two
            fearsome statues of the Shinto gods of wind and thunder. Passing
            through the gate, you will enter a bustling street lined with shops
            selling traditional souvenirs, snacks, and street food.
          </p>
          <p>
            Which is why if you are visiting Japan your first stop should be the
            Senso-ji Temple and subsequently Kyoto to experience historial
            Japanese buildings and landscapes.
