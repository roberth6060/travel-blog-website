          <h3>My Experience In The United Kingdom</h3>
          <p>
            As soon as we arrive in London, my friends and I can feel the energy
            of the city all around us. We're all buzzing with excitement, eager
            to explore everything this incredible place has to offer. However,
            we were a bit taken aback by the obsurd prices for transportation
            from the airport to our Airbnb. The Black Cab prices cost us a Â£150
            to our location which was near the center of London, which kinda
            limited our experience in the UK as we were able visit select few
            places due to high price for transportation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regardless of the setback, the next day after arriving in the UK our
            first stop was the iconic Big Ben clock tower. We snap some photos
            and take in the stunning architecture of the surrounding buildings.
            From there, we wander through the bustling streets of the city,
            taking in the sights and sounds of the vibrant neighborhoods around
            us.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of our favorite experiences is visiting the Buckingham Palace
            and then the British Museum, where we're awestruck by the incredible
            artifacts from around the world. We spend hours wandering through
            the exhibits, marveling at the ancient sculptures, mummies, and
            treasures on display.

          <p>
            Of course, we can't leave London without experiencing the city's
            famous food scene. We indulge in delicious fish and chips, hearty
            pub fare, and traditional English breakfasts during our stay. We
            also make sure to stop at one of London's many trendy cafes for some
            delicious coffee and pastries. Overall the food was amazing, but it
            took us some time to get used to eating eggs and sausage with beans
            because at first it was not a flattering taste to our taste buds.
          </p>
          <p>
            As our trip comes to an end, we reflect on all of the amazing
            memories we've made together in London. From exploring historic
            landmarks to trying new foods, we've had an unforgettable experience
            in this incredible city. We know we'll be back again someday to
            create even more amazing memories together.
