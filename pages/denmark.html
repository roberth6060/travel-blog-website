          <h3>Living In Copenhagen, Denamrk</h3>
          <h4>Opinion On Denmark</h4>
          <p>
            Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, is a vibrant and livable city
            with a population of over 1.3 million people in the metropolitan
            area (worldpopulationreview, 2023). Denmark is also known for being
            a social democracy, which means that it is a society that combines
            elements of capitalism with a strong welfare state. This system is
            characterized by a high level of social and economic equality, as
            well as a commitment to universal healthcare, education, and social
            services. The city has a reputation for being one of the happiest
            cities in the world, and living there for a year its not hard to see
            why. From my experience the people there are always happy and always
            enjoy spending time off work with family and friend, which the
            locals decribe as "hygge."
          </p>
          <h4>What is Hygge?</h4>
          <p>
            Hygge (pronounced "hoo-ga") is a Danish term that is difficult to
            translate directly into English, but it is often described as a
            feeling of coziness, comfort, and contentment. It is a cultural
            concept that is deeply ingrained in Danish society, and it
            represents a way of life that is centered around creating a warm and
            welcoming atmosphere. Hygge is all about creating a sense of comfort
            and relaxation, often through activities such as spending time with
            loved ones, drinking hot beverages, and lighting candles. It can
            also involve enjoying good food, reading a book, or simply being
            present in the moment. Hygge is not just about physical comfort, but
            also emotional well-being. It encourages people to cultivate a sense
            of mindfulness and gratitude, and to appreciate the simple pleasures
            of life. This can include enjoying the beauty of nature, connecting
            with others, or indulging in a favorite hobby.
          </p>
          <h4>My Overall Experience In Denmark</h4>
          <p>
            Moving to Copenhagen, Denmark is the first time I ever been to
            Europe, so at first I did not know what to expect I thought
            initially it would be quite similar to the United State. But I was
            wrong and Denmark was vastly different from the United States. The
            locals can often come off as cold individual since most typically
            never talk to outside there friend or family group. Though once you
            get to know the local, you would find that despite their cold
            exterior, the locals are quite friendly and kind people.
          </p>

          <p>
            Also, one of the most notable aspects of living in Copenhagen that I
            liked was the country's emphasis on sustainability and
            environmentalism. The city has a strong commitment to renewable
            energy, cycling, and green spaces, with plenty of bike lanes, parks,
            and green roofs throughout the city. This makes it easy to get
            around without a car and enjoy the outdoors. I never had a need to
            drive in Denmark, often utilizing the subway system and the
            dedicated bike lane to commute work.
          </p>
          <h4>The Food In Denmark</h4>
          <p>
            Copenhagen is also known for its culinary scene, with a wide variety
            of restaurants serving traditional Danish cuisine as well as
            international dishes. The city is particularly famous for its
            pastries, such as the flaky, buttery danish pastry. I enjoyed food
            such as Medister Sausage, Meatballs, Bearnaise Sauce, Potato Salad,
            Fried Pork Belly with Parsley Sauce, and Smørrebrød.

          <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>
            Overall, living in Copenhagen offers a high quality of life, with a
            strong focus on sustainability, culture, and cuisine. I thoroughly
            enjoyed living in the city and walking and biking around just
            enjoying looking at the water and the buildings.
